# AsthmaHealth

Rewrite of the ResearchKit [AsthmaHealth](https://github.com/ResearchKit/AsthmaHealth) app using the CloudMine backend.

## Getting Started

Requires [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management

```
#> sudo gem install cocoapods
#> git clone git@github.com:cloudmine/AsthmaHealth.git
#> cd AsthmaHealth
#> cp AsthmaHealth/SupportingFiles/Secrets.h-Template AsthmaHealth/SupportingFiles/Secrets.h
#> pod install
#> open AsthmaHealth.xcworkspace
```

The project should now open and build.

** BE SURE TO EDIT `Secret.h` to add your CloudMine App ID & API Keys **
